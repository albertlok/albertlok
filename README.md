Hi, Iâ€™m @albertlok ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a mechanical design engineer now making a switch into data engineering and analytics.
The goal is to jump on the trending skills and workspace of the future.
To that end, I'm currently brushing up on programming and learning new skills for data engineering.

I would appreciate any tips and pointers from those who have taken this path before me!
